# adl_cancer_detection

Using deep models (Tensorflow) and computer vision methods to detect and classify cancer in images of biopsied lymph nodes. The source of the images is the CAMELYON16 challenge. Methodologies are inspired by the Liu et al. (2017) paper: Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images. A final project for Applied Deep Learning taught by Joshua Gordon at Columbia University in fall 2018.
